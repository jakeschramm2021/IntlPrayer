This project is designed to allow people to partner across the globe through prayer.
This is for Christian prayer partners. 

There will be:
1. An opportunity to interact on an interactive basis with prayer topics for one's self by entering in responses (prayers) and logging them for that topic / question. 

There will also be:

2. A (2D) but real-time map of the globe, with particular topics that that region is praying for so that the other regions of the globe on this network / through this app can see what is being prayed for. 

I will also upload a full sheet with ALL topics being prayed for, with their associated regions. This will be so that everyone (the public) can see what is being prayed for with a sense of more "totality".
